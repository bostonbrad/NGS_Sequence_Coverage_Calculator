# NGS_Sequence_Coverage_Calculator
Calculates Next Generation Sequencing coverage for specific locations on sequence reads

This calculator takes NGS Sequencing read data and calculates, for specific loci along the sequence, the coverage of the given loci. 

The program does not attempt to check that the input files have data in a specific format. It assumes that the first line is a column header, and that the file has 2 columns, delimited by a comma. Other system and version information is displayed below for consistency of results.
